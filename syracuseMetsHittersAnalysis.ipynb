    "## League Averages Comparison\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "In terms of batting average, Brett Baty sits at just above the league average. But if we continue to look down his stat line, he's anything but average. Baty's in the top half of the league for OBP which is incredibly valuable in today's game. You need base runners to score runs. However, this is not where his strangth is. His strength lies in his SLG/power. His slugging percentage is in the top quartile for the league, pretty handidly too. He's also in the top quartile for OPS. On a basic level, this shows his ability to hit for power while not compromising his ability to get on base. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I'll be looking at Mark Vientos. Although Mark Vientos has already been promoted to the Majors, it's important to look at the stats of players that have been called up and had success in the MLB. And I would definitely put Mark Vientos in this category with his incredible 2024 season. When looking at Vientos' batting average, it's clear he was having some level of success at the plate. He ranked in the upper quartile comfortably. Suprsingly, this is true for all of his stats except OBP where he still ranked in the 3rd quartile. Similar to Baty, Mark Vientos' slash line conveys his ability to hit for power but where he outperforms Baty is getting on base and getting on base through contact. However, Baty still does slightly have the edge in terms of power if we're basing this purely on slugging percentage. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now lets take a look at one of our top prospects: Luisangel Acuña. At first glance, his slash line is extremly underwhelming. For every stat except batting average, he ranks in the bottom quartile of the league. And even his batting average only falls into the third quartile. This tells me that despite the fact he can get on base fairly well through his hits, his overall ability to get on base as well as his power is lacking.\n",
    "\n",
    "A lot of these observations for Acuña can made for Drew Gilbert as well thus far. They also fall into the bottom quartile for all slash line stats as well as OBP. However, with Drew Gilbert it's important to note his experience in AAA so far. He's barely had 100 plate appearences and more likely than not just needs more time to adjust to AAA. He previously put up decent numbers in the lower levels. We traded Rylan Thomas for Ryne Stanek so I won't focus on him too much.\n",

    "## Actual Stats vs Expected Stats\n",
    "Before looking at potential reasons why these player's stats look like this, it's important to see how they're peforming vs their expected stats. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's examine Brett Baty. \n",
    "While it's true Brett Baty is outpeforming Luisangel Acuña on offense, his actual stats are lower than his expected stats in every category. This could be the case for a number of reasons and doesn't necessarily mean he's underperforming. Since Baty's batting average is lower than his expected output, this could suggest a number of possibilities. It is very possible he's just outright underperorming, but more likely than not it means he's getting very unlucky with some hard hit balls or hitting against some difficult defensive alignments. I say this because a .278 xBA is still great and if Baty continues to hit like this, we should see his actual batting average go up. I would give a similar analysis to his OBP vs xOBP, SLG vs xSLG, and wOBA vs xwOBA. If Baty continues the quality of his at bats and contact, his slash line should continue to trend up.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next lets look at an interesting case: Mark Vientos. Despite the fact that he's doing better than Baty in every stat besides SLG, all of his expected stats are lower than Baty's. Since Vientos' actual stats are significantly higher than his expected, this could be indicative of a few things. It could mean he's getting lucky for the quality of his contact. Maybe he's getting a few lucky bounces or bloop hits that would raise his average. Or he could be potentially hitting home runs/extra-base hits that might not always carry out of the park or fall in for hits. While this might indicate his actual stats aren't sustainable, I peronsally believe these should be taken with a grain of salt. It's important to also look at the quality of contact and power a hitter is making to come to a complete conclusion, which we'll do later on. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's move on to Luisangel Acuna. Similar to Vientos, he's outpeforming his expected stats except all of his actual and expected stats are lower than Vientos'. This shows me that if Vientos is getting lucky, then Acuna is getting nearly as lucky as seeing less of a payoff for it. His average is lower, he's getting on base less, and power is lacking. So the observations we made for Vientos' contact quality and base hit luck are same that I'd make here and really for all the prospects beneath Acuna as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "While I think these are important stats to note and observe, I don't know if they necessarily directly translate to any concrete predictiohs. While Baty's expected stats are better than Vientos', Baty has struggled at the major league level while Vientos has seen success this season. This is not to say ignore these stats, but they do not always paint a full picture."
