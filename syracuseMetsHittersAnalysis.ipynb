    "In this analysis we're going to be looking at basic stats collected from Baseball Refernce and new advanced stats scraped from Baseball Savant's minor league stat cast database.\n",
    "I'm going to focus on hitters with over 100 plate appearences so we can get an accurate understanding of players who have a decent sample size of play in AAA. I'll also be looking at players under the age of 27 since the Mets as an organization have a large focus on their young prospects that can help the team win in the near future."

    "## League Averages Comparison\n",
    "In terms of batting average, Brett Baty sits at below the league average. But if we continue to look down his stat line, he's anything but average. Baty's in the top half of the league for OBP which is incredibly valuable in today's game. You need base runners to score runs. However, this is not where his strangth is. His strength lies in his SLG/power. His slugging percentage is in the top quartile for the league, pretty handidly too. He's also in the top quartile for OPS. On a basic level, this shos his ability to hit for power while not compromising his ability to get on base.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I'll be looking at Mark Vientos. Although Mark Vientos has already been promoted to the Majors, it's important to look at the stats of players that have been called up and had success in the MLB. And I would definitely put Mark Vientos in this category with his incredible 2024 season. When looking at Vientos' batting average, it's clear he was having some level of success at the plate. He ranked in the upper quartile comfortably. Suprsingly, this is true for all of his stats except OBP where he still ranked in the 3rd quartile. Similar to Baty, Mark Vientos' slash line conveys his ability to hit for power but where he outperforms Baty is getting on base and getting on base through contact. However, Baty still does slightly have the edge in terms of power if we're basing this purely on slugging percentage. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now lets take a look at one of our top prospects: Luisangel Acuña. At first glance, his slash line is extremly underwhelming. For every stat except batting average, he ranks in the bottom quartile of the league. And even his batting average only falls into the third quartile. This tells me that despite the fact he can get on base fairly well through his hits, his overall ability to get on base as well as his power is lacking.\n",
    "\n",
    "A lot of these observations for Acuña can made for Drew Gilbert as well thus far. They also fall into the bottom quartile for all slash line stats as well as OBP. However, with Drew Gilbert it's important to note his experience in AAA so far. He's barely had 100 plate appearences and more likely than not just needs more time to adjust to AAA. He previously put up decent numbers in the lower levels. We traded Rylan Thomas for Ryne Stanek so I won't focus on him too much. "
